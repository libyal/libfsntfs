* $UsnJrnl:$J parsing
  - move UsnJrnl parsing into library ?
  - add support for $UsnJrnl:$J file parsing

* API
  - expose logged utility stream attribute

Format:
* index
  - group equivalent index data values
* boot block
  - remove value restriction add sanity check
* add support for attributes:
  - logged utillity stream (LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM) (partial)
* pre NTFS 3.0 attribute types
  - volume version
* filenames
  - ignoring short filenames for now?
* ntfs3g indicates volume is hibernated, could this be stored in the volume flags?

Tools:
* fsntfsinfo
  - print ADS
  - move UsnJrnl to separate tool?
  - fix remnant data in buffer and remove work around
  - sanitize control characters in filenames
  - add detection of BDE and VSS
  - add support for $LogFile
  - print $DATA attribute size

Error tolerance:
* Support partial images/file systems

Tests:
* file with resident data
* file with non-resident data
* file with sparse data
* file with compressed data
* file with valid data size < data size
* file with ADS
* directory with ADS

Performance:
* compact attribute union data/file reference (use type to distinguish between them)

Debug:
* print volume information flags description
